- [Chromium/Firefox extension](https://github.com/HexHyperion/Kuusho-Extension)

Taste the power of freedom with Kuusho, an app to help you break free from the chains of corporate dictatorship and rebel against the imposed alteration of your communication!

With Kuusho (jap. void) you can finally express your emotion like your ancestors at the dawn of the computer, with a range of no more than 96 symbols hand-constructed with electrons right on the motherboard!

While the last part might be... inaccurate, the point stands nonetheless - the "void" symbol forestalls programs from automatically detecting emotes, enabling your cute uwu owo faces to appear unaltered on your interlocutor's screen, like this :D
